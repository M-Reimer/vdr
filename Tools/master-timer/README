epg.data

3. Config-Files
---------------

For all files: One Entry per Line. Each line is a "Regular Expresion" 
               So you can use all Perl-Style REs you want.
               The RE are matched with "i" so they are case insensitive!
               (Except for the "done"-list, these must match excatly!)

deepblack: Blacklist of "Titles" you NEVER EVER want to get to you eyes

subtitle-movies: A list of "Subtitles" which indicate a movie. 
                 (For Channels that correctly fill out the Subtitle. 
                  e.g. it won't work for *eRTL*)

torecord:  The titles/subtitles/Description you want to record

done: 	The titles/subtitles which are already recorded/should not be recorded
        (Programmed Timers which got inserted into "done" will be deleted 
         automaticaly)

4. Notices
----------

- Recordings "overlapping" on the same channel, will be joined into one Timer
- Title/Subtitle/Descriptions are "fixed" for Channel that don't fill them 
  out "correctly" (Currently the "Bugs" from Pro-7/VOX/VIVA)
  Pro7: Remove the Title from the Subtitle  '<Title> / <Subtitle>'
  VOX/VIVA: Subtitle is enclosed into "" and after ". " is the description
  VIVA: When the Subtitle beginns with space the subtitle is moved to
        description
  All (except the second VIVA one) fixes are tried onto ALL Subtitles.

5. Known-Bugs
-------------

- It isn't checked if there are enough DVB-Cards
- Overlapping Timers, on the same channel, are always joined
- JOINed timers which are "done" don't get deleted automaticaly
