Master-Timer
============

1. Introduction
---------------

Master-Timer is a system designed for automatically recording movies.
Upon execution it reads its configuration files, scans the file "epg.data"
in the current directory for matching titles and programs them via SVDRP
into VDR.

You may for example run Master-Timer as a cron job.

2. Config files
---------------

Configuration files are located in "~/.master-timer". Each entry is a
regular expression so you can use all Perl style REs you want. They are
processed case insensitive.

config: Main configuration file.

deepblack: Blacklist of "titles" you NEVER EVER want to see.

subtitle-movies: A list of "Subtitles" which indicate a movie (used
  by the "MOVIE" macro in torecord).
  For channels that correctly fill out the subtitle e.g. it will not
  work with *eRTL*.

torecord:  The titles you want to record.

done: 	The titles/subtitles which are already recorded/should not be recorded
  Programmed timers which got inserted into "done" will be deleted
  automatically.

channels-to-scan: Used only by the separate "scan-channels" script which
  switches through channels in order to get EPG data.

4. Notices
----------

- Recordings overlapping on the same channel will be joined into one timer
- Title/Subtitle/Descriptions are "fixed" for channels that don't fill them 
  out correctly (Pro-7/VOX/VIVA)
  Pro7: Remove the Title from the Subtitle  '<Title> / <Subtitle>'
  VOX/VIVA: Subtitle is enclosed into "" and after ". " is the description
  VIVA: When the Subtitle beginns with space the subtitle is moved to
        description
  All (except the second VIVA one) fixes are tried onto ALL Subtitles.

5. Known-Bugs
-------------

- It isn't checked if there are enough DVB-Cards
- Overlapping timers on the same channel are always joined
- Joined timers which are "done" don't get deleted automatically
