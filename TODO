TODO list for the Video Disk Recorder project
---------------------------------------------

* Implement recording to disk and playback from disk.
* Make it work with two DVB-S PCI cards to allow simultaneous
  recording of one programme, while replaying another programme
  (or maybe the same one, but time delayed).
  Maybe we can do this with only a single card, if the card
  driver/firmware allows simultaneuos record/playback?
* Implement "on-disk editing" to allow "cutting out" of certain
  scenes in order to archive them (or, reversely, cut out
  commercial breaks).
