TODO list for the Video Disk Recorder project
---------------------------------------------

* Implement simultaneous record/replay with a single DVB card once
  the card driver/firmware allows this.
* Implement "on-disk editing" to allow "cutting out" of certain
  scenes in order to archive them (or, reversely, cut out
  commercial breaks).
* Implement channel scanning.
* Implement remaining commands in SVDRP.
