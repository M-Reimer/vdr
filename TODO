TODO list for the Video Disk Recorder project
---------------------------------------------

* Implement a way to add and delete channels and timers.
* Implement recording to disk and playback from disk.
* Implement disk file management (delete old/viewed files to make
  room for new recordings if necessary).
* Make it work with two DVB-S PCI cards to allow simultaneous
  recording of one programme, while replaying another programme
  (or maybe the same one, but time delayed).
* Implement "on-disk editing" to allow "cutting out" of certain
  scenes in order to archive them (or, reversely, cut out
  commercial breaks).
