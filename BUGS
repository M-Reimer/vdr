Video Disk Recorder - Known Bugs
--------------------------------

* Sometimes the picture "jumps" as if a frame is skipped.
  Presumably this is a problem in the card driver or firmware?

* When the on-screen display is activated during recording,
  the video data stream gets corrupted, which results in a
  distorted picture when replaying such a recording.
  I assume this is a problem in the driver of firmware.
  There is no such problem in replay mode.
