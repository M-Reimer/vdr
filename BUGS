Video Disk Recorder - Known Bugs
--------------------------------

* Sometimes picture and sound drift apart.
  Presumably this is a problem in the card driver or firmware?

* When the on-screen display is activated during recording,
  the video data stream gets corrupted, which results in a
  distorted picture when replaying such a recording.
  I assume this is a problem in the driver of firmware.
  There is no such problem in replay mode.

* After a replay session the screen may go blank.
  Haven't figured out yet how to ensure that it switches back to
  the current channel.

* Every now and then the on-screen display shows nothing but
  "noise". If that occurs, I have to stop the 'osm' program
  and do a 'make reload' for the card driver. After that it
  works fine again.
  Presumably this is a problem in the card driver or firmware?
  Or could it be a problem with the hardware?
  Does anybody else observe this?
