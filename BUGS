Video Disk Recorder - Known Bugs
--------------------------------

* Sometimes the picture "jumps" as if a frame is skipped.
  Presumably this is a problem in the card driver or firmware?

* The first picture captured with the GRAB command in SVDRP
  is empty. Also, these pictures appear to be too dark.
