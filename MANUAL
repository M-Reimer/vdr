* Remote Control Keys

  The following remote control keys are used to control the VDR
  operation. To keep the number of different keys as small as
  possible, several keys have different meanings in the various
  modes:

* Navigating through the On Screen Menus

  The "Main" menu can be called up with the "Menu" key of your remote
  control unit. The "Up" and "Down" keys are used to select a specific
  item. The "Left" and "Right" keys can be used to change options, and
  the numeric keys allow direct input of numeric data. The "Ok" key
  confirms any changes (or switches to a channel in the "Channels" menu).
  The "Back" key goes back one level in the menu structure, discarding
  any changes that might have been made in the current menu.
  
  In the "Timers" menu, the current timer can be enabled or disabled with
  the "Right" or "Left" key, respectively (enabled timers are marked with ">").
  "Ok" here opens the "Edit timer" menu.
  
  Textual options, like channel names or recording file names, can be edited
  by pressing the "Right" button (which puts brackets around the current
  character as in "[R]TL"), selecting the desired character position with
  "Left" and "Right", and changing the character with the "Up" and "Down"
  keys. "Ok" then confirms the changes.
  
  The "Red", "Green", "Yellow" and "Blue" buttons have special meanings
  in various menus and are listed at the bottom of the on-screen-display.
  
  At any point in the menu system, pressing the "Menu" key again will
  immediately leave the menu system (discarding any pending changes).

* Selecting a Channel

  There are three ways to select a channel:

  1. With no On Screen Menu displayed press the "Up" or "Down" key to switch
     to the next higher or lower channel.
  2. Press the "Menu" button to bring up the On Screen Menu, select "Channels"
     and browse through the list with the "Up" and "Down" key; to switch to the
     selected channel press "Ok".
  2. Directly type in the channel number with the numeric keys ('0'..'9');
     if no key is pressed for about half a second, the digits collected so
     far will define the channel number.

  After switching to a different channel the channel number and name, as well
  as the current time are displayed at the top of the screen. This line
  automatically goes away after about two seconds, or if any key is pressed.
  To bring up the channel display without switching channels you can press
  the "Ok" button.

* Instant Recording

  You can start recording the current channel by pressing the "Red" button
  in the Main menu. This will create a timer event named "@channelname" that
  starts at the current time and records for two hours.
  If you want to modify the recording time you need to edit the timer.
  Stop instant recording by pressing the "Menu" button and selecting
  "Stop Recording", or by disabling the timer.

* Replaying a Recording

  All recordings are listed in the "Recordings" menu. Browse through the
  list with the "Up" and "Down" button and press "Ok" (or the "Red" button)
  to start playback.
  Playback can be stopped via the Main menu by selecting "Stop replaying",
  or by pressing the "Blue" button outside the menu.

* Replay Control

  The following keys have the listed meaning in Replay mode:

  - Up      Positions to beginning of the recording and starts playback
            from there.
  - Down    Halts playback at the current position. Press again to continue
            playback.
  - Blue    Stops playback and stores the current position, so that
            playback can be resumed later at that point.
  - Left
    Right   Runs playback forward or backward at a higher speed. Press
            again to resume normal speed.
  - Green
    Yellow  Skips about 60 seconds back or forward.
  - Ok      Brings up the replay progress display, which shows the date,
            time and title of the recording, a progress bar and the
            current and total time of the recording.
            Press "Ok" again to turn off the progress display.

* Programming the Timer

  Use the "Timer" menu to maintain your list of timer controlled recordings.
