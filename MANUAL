* Remote Control Keys

  The following remote control keys are used to control the VDR
  operation. To keep the number of different keys as small as
  possible, several keys have different meanings in the various
  modes:

  Key     Normal      Main       Channels   Timer      Edit/New      Recordings  Replay

* Navigating through the On Screen Menus

  The "Main" menu can be called up with the "Menu" key of your remote
  control unit. The "Up" and "Down" keys are used to select a specific
  item. The "Left" and "Right" keys can be used to change options, and
  the numeric keys allow direct input of numeric data. The "Ok" key
  confirms any changes (or switches to a channel in the "Channels" menu).
  The "Back" key goes back one level in the menu structure, discarding
  any changes that might have been made in the current menu.
  
  In the "Timers" menu, the current timer can be enabled or disabled with
  the "Right" or "Left" key, respectively (enabled timers are marked with ">").
  "Ok" here opens the "Edit timer" menu.
  
  Textual options, like channel names or recording file names, can be edited
  by pressing the "Right" button (which puts brackets around the current
  character as in "[R]TL"), selecting the desired character position with
  "Left" and "Right", and changing the character with the "Up" and "Down"
  keys. "Ok" then confirms the changes. The special character '^' can be used
  to "cut off" a string at this position. When this character is visible in the
  brackets (as in abc[^]), the next press to the "Left" or "Ok" button will
  actually cut off the string. Using "Up" and/or "Down" brings back the
  original rest of the string (unless you have pressed "Left" or "Ok").
  
  The "Red", "Green", "Yellow" and "Blue" buttons have special meanings
  in various menus and are listed at the bottom of the on-screen-display.
  
  At any point in the menu system, pressing the "Menu" key again will
  immediately leave the menu system (discarding any pending changes).

* The "Schedule" Menu

  The "Schedule" menu implements VDR's "Electronic Program Guide" (EPG).

  Select "Schedule" from the "Main" menu and you get a list of all upcoming
  broadcasts on the current channel.

  "Up" and "Down" can be used to scroll through this list, and pressing "Ok"
  displays detailed information about the selected programme. Pressing "Ok"
  again (or pressing "Back") gets you back into the "Schedule" menu.

  From the "Schedule" menu, the "Green" button opens the "What's on now?"
  menu, which displays all programmes that are currently running on all
  channels that broadcast their programme information on the current
  transponder, or from channels that have been current lately (VDR stores
  all information it gathers in an internal list). The more channels you
  have been switching through lately, the longer this list will be.
  The "Yellow" button opens the "What's on next?" menu, which lists all
  programmes that will start next on all channels.

  Inside the "What's on now/next?" menus the "Green" button toggles between
  the "Now" and "Next" display, and the "Yellow" button takes you to the
  "Schedule" menu of the current channel in the list.

  The "Red" button allows you to instantly program a timer to record the
  selected programme. You will get into the "Edit Timer" menu in which
  everything has already been filled in, and you can make any modifications
  you may want to apply. Note that the Start and Stop time are offset by the
  MarginStart and MarginStop parameters (see Setup) in order to make sure the
  entire programme is recorded in case it doesn't exactly adhere to its
  published start/stop times. Of course, no guarantee can be given that the
  default margin values will be sufficient, so in case this recording is
  really important you may want to add an extra margin ;-)

  The "Blue" button can be pressed to switch to the channel with the selected
  programme.

* Selecting a Channel

  There are four ways to select a channel:

  1. With no On Screen Menu displayed press the "Up" or "Down" key to switch
     to the next higher or lower channel.
  2. Press the "Menu" button to bring up the On Screen Menu, select "Channels"
     and browse through the list with the "Up" and "Down" key; to switch to the
     selected channel press "Ok".
  3. Directly type in the channel number with the numeric keys ('0'..'9');
     if no key is pressed for about half a second, the digits collected so
     far will define the channel number.
  4. From the "Now", "Next" and "Event" menus (accessible through the "Schedule"
     menu) by pressing the "Blue" button.

  Pressing the '0' key in normal viewing mode toggles between the current and
  the previous channel.

  After switching to a different channel the channel number and name, as well
  as the current time are displayed at the top of the screen. If available, the
  'current/next' information will be displayed below this line. This display
  automatically goes away after about five seconds, or if any key is pressed.
  To bring up the channel display without switching channels you can press
  the "Ok" button.

* Switching through channel groups

  If the 'channels.conf' file contains "group separators" you can switch
  through these groups by pressing the "Left" and "Right" key while no
  menu is being displayed. The channel display will show the name of the
  group, and if you press the "Ok" button while the group name is being
  displayed, you will switch to the first channel of that group.

  Channel groups can be whatever you decide them to be. You can either
  group your channels by "Bouquet", by language, genre or whatever your
  preferences may be.

* Instant Recording

  You can start recording the current channel by pressing the "Red" button
  in the "Main" menu. This will create a timer event named "@channelname" that
  starts at the current time and records for two hours.
  If you want to modify the recording time you need to edit the timer.
  Stop instant recording by pressing the "Menu" button and selecting
  "Stop Recording", or by disabling the timer.

* Replaying a Recording

  All recordings are listed in the "Recordings" menu. Browse through the
  list with the "Up" and "Down" button and press "Ok" (or the "Red" button)
  to start playback. New recordings are marked with an '*'.
  Playback can be stopped via the "Main" menu by selecting "Stop replaying",
  or by pressing the "Blue" button outside the menu.
  A previously stopped playback session can be resumed by pressing the "Blue"
  button in the "Main" menu.

* Replay Control

  The following keys have the listed meaning in Replay mode:

  - Up      Resumes normal replay from any "pause", "forward" or "backward"
            mode.
  - Down    Halts playback at the current position. Press again to continue
            playback.
  - Blue    Stops playback and stores the current position, so that
            playback can be resumed later at that point.
  - Left
    Right   Runs playback forward or backward at a higher speed; press
            again to resume normal speed. If in Pause mode, runs forward or
            backward at a slower speed; press again to return to pause mode.
            Pressing and holding down the button performs the function until
            the button is released again.
  - Green
    Yellow  Skips about 60 seconds back or forward.
            Pressing and holding down the button performs the function until
            the button is released again.
  - Ok      Brings up the replay progress display, which shows the date,
            time and title of the recording, a progress bar and the
            current and total time of the recording.
            Press "Ok" again to turn off the progress display.
  - Back    Stops replaying and brings up the "Recordings" menu. This can be
            used to easily delete a recording after watching it, or to switch
            to a different recording.

* Editing a Recording

  While in Replay mode, the following keys can be used to manipulate editing
  marks:

  - 0       Toggles an editing mark. If the mark indicator shows a red triangle,
            the current mark is deleted. Otherwise a new mark is set at the
            current position.
  - 4, 6    Move an editing mark back and forward. You need to first jump to
            an editing mark for this to work.
  - 7, 9    Jump back and forward between editing marks. Replay goes into still
            mode after jumping to a mark.
  - 8       Positions replay at a point 3 seconds before the current or next
            "start" mark and starts replay.
  - 2       Start the actual cutting process.

  Editing marks are represented by black, vertical lines in the progress display.
  A small black triangle at the top of the mark means that this is a "start"
  mark, and a triangle at the bottom means that this is an "end" mark.
  The cutting process will save all video data between "start" and "end" marks
  into a new file (the original recording remains untouched). The new file will
  have the same name as the original recording, preceeded with a '%' character
  (imagine the '%' somehow looking like a pair of scissors ;-). Red bars in the
  progress display indicate which video sequences will be saved by the cutting
  process.

  The video sequences to be saved by the cutting process are determined by an
  "even/odd" algorithm. This means that every odd numbered editing mark (i.e.
  1, 3, 5,...) represents a "start" mark, while every even numbered mark (2, 4,
  6,...) is an "end" mark. Inserting or toggling a mark on or off automatically
  adjusts the sequence to the right side of that mark.

  Use the keys described under "Replay Control" to position to, e.g., the
  beginning and end of commercial breaks and press the '0' key to set the
  necessary editing marks. After that you may want to use the '7' and '9'
  keys to jump to each mark and maybe use the '4' and '6' keys to fine tune
  them. Once all marks are in place, press '2' to start the actual cutting
  process, which will run as a background process. When replaying the edited
  version of the recording you can use the '8' key to jump to a point just
  before the next cut and have a look at the resulting sequence.

  Currently editing marks can only be set at I-frames, which typically is
  every 12th frame. So editing can be done with a resolution of roughly half
  a second. A "start" mark marks the first frame of a resulting video
  sequence, and an "end" mark marks the last frame of that sequence.

* Programming the Timer

  Use the "Timer" menu to maintain your list of timer controlled recordings.
  The parameters in the "Edit Timer" menu have the following meanings:

  Active:    Defines whether the timer will be processed (set it to 'no' to
             temporarily desable a timer).
  Channel:   The channel to be recorded (as defined in the "Channels" list).
             Any changes made in the "Channels" list (like renaming or
             reordering channels) will be automatically reflected in the
             timers settings.
  Day:       The day on which this timer shall start. This can be either a
             "day of month" (1..31), which allows programming a "single shot"
             timer that hits once and is deleted after it ends. Single shot
             timers can be programmed up to one month into the future.
             Another option here are "repeating timers" which are defined
             by listing the days of the week on which they shall record.
             For example, a timer that shall record every monday and wednesday
             would have a Day setting of "M-W----".
  Start:     The start time of the timer in hh:mm as 24 hour ("military") time.
  Stop:      The stop time of the timer.
  Priority:  The Priority (0..99) is used to decide which timer shall be
             started in case there are two or more timers with the exact same
             start time. The first timer in the list with the highest Priority
             will be used. This value is also stored with the recording and is
             later used to decide which recording to remove from disk in order
             to free space for a new recording. If the disk is full and a new
             recording needs more space, an existing recording with the lowest
             Priority (and which has exceeded its guaranteed Lifetime) will be
             removed. If all available DVB cards are currently occupied, a
             timer with a higher priority will interrupt the timer with the
             lowest priority in order to start recording.
  Lifetime:  The number of days (0..99) a recording made through this timer is
             guaranteed to remain on disk before it is automatically removed
             to free up space for a new recording. Note that setting this
             parameter to very high values for all recordings may soon fill up
             the entire disk and cause new recordings to fail due to low disk
             space.
  File:      The name under which a recording created through this timer will
             be stored on disk (the actual name will also contain the date and
             time, so it is possible to have a "repeating timer" store all its
             recordings under the same name; they will be distinguishable by
             their date and time).
             If this field is left blank, the channel name will be used to form
             the name of the recording.

  A timer can also be programmed by pressing the "Red" button on the "Schedule",
  "Now", "Next" or "Event" menus.

* Parameters in the "Setup" menu

  Select "Setup" from the "Main" menu to enter the setup menu. From there you can
  modify the following system parameters (note that "boolean" values will be
  displayed as "no" and "yes" in the "Setup" menu, while in the setup file they
  are stored as '0' and '1', respectively):

  OSDLanguage = 0        Defines the language used to display the OSD texts.
                         0 = Englisch
                         1 = Deutsch

  PrimaryDVB = 1         Defines the primary DVB interface (i.e. the one that
                         will display the menus and will react on input through
                         the remote control). Valid values range from '1' to the
                         number of installed DVB cards. If more than one DVB card
                         is installed and a recording is to be started, the
                         program will try to use a free DVB card that is different
                         from the primary DVB interface, so that the viewer will
                         be disturbed as little as possible.

  ShowInfoOnChSwitch = 1 Turns the display of the current/next information on
                         or off when switching the channel. The information is
                         always displayed when pressing the "Ok" button in
                         normal viewing mode.

  MenuScrollPage = 1     0 = when pressing the "Down" ("Up") key while the cursor
                             is on the last (first) line of a list page, the
                             list is advanced by a full page and the cursor will
                             be at the top (bottom) of that page
                         1 = dto., but the cursor remains at the bottom (top) of
                             the page (this mode allows for faster scrolling
                             through long lists).

  MarkInstantRecord = 1  Defines whether an "instant recording" (started by
                         pressing the "Red" button in the "Main" menu) will be
                         marked with a '@' character to make it distinguishable
                         from timer recordings in the "Recordings" menu.
                         0 = instant recordings will not be marked
                         1 = instant recordings will be marked.

  LnbFrequLo = 9750      The low and high LNB frequencies (in MHz)
  LnbFrequHi = 10600

  SetSystemTime = 0      Defines whether the system time will be set according to
                         the time received from the DVB data stream.
                         0 = system time will not be set
                         1 = system time wil be set
                         Note that this works only if VDR is running under a user
                         id that has permisson to set the system time.

  MarginStart = 2        Defines how many minutes before the official start time
  MarginStop = 10        of a broadcast VDR shall start recording, and how long
                         after the official end time it shall stop recording.

  EPGScanTimeout = 5     The time (in hours) of user inactivity after which the
                         DVB card in a single card system starts scanning channels
                         to keep the EPG up-to-date.
                         A value of '0' turns off scanning on a single card system.

* Executing system commands

  The "Main" menu option "Commands" allows you to execute any system commands
  defined in the configuration file 'commands.conf' (see FORMATS for details).
  The "Commands" option will only be present in the "Main" menu if a valid
  'commands.conf' file containing at least one command definition has been
  found at program start.

  This feature can be used to do virtually anything, like checking for new
  mail, displaying the CPU temperature - you name it! All you need to do is
  enter the necessary command definition into 'commands.conf' and implement
  the actual command that will be called. Such a command can typically be a
  shell script or a Perl program. Anything that command writes to stdout will
  be displayed on a result screen after executing the command. This screen will
  use a 'fixed' font so that you can generate formatted output. In order to
  avoid error messages going to stderr, command definitions should redirect
  stderr to stdout (see FORMATS).

  WARNING: THE COMMANDS DEFINED IN 'commands.conf' WILL BE EXECUTED UNDER THE
  =======  SAME USER ID THAT VDR IS RUNNING WITH. BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN
           DEFINING THESE COMMANDS AND MAKE SURE THEY DON'T HARM YOUR SYSTEM,
           ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE RUNNING VDR UNDER A HIGH PRIVILEGED USER ID
           (LIKE 'root').
