Video Disk Recorder Revision History
------------------------------------

2000-02-19: Version 0.01 (Initial revision).

2000-03-11: Version 0.02

- Fixed compilation with only DEBUG_REMOTE=1.
- Menus now use colors.
- Support for "Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue" buttons.
- Channels and Timers can now be added, deleted and moved.
- Basic record/play file handling support (no actual record/playback yet).

2000-04-15: Version 0.03

- Actual record/replay now works.
- Dropped the idea of different "recording qualities" (a 36GB harddisk is
  able to store some 18 hours in full quality, so we don't really need that).
- Termination signals are now caught and the program cleans up before exiting.
- Support for CICAM.

2000-04-24: Version 0.04

- Changed name from 'osm' to 'vdr' to avoid mixups with the 'oms' program that
  appears to be in use with DVD replay.
- Implemented a channel display in the top menu line.
- Implemented replay progress display (press "Ok" when replaying to bring it up).
- Implemented direct channel selecting by pressing the numeric keys.
- Added several 'const' keywords to please stricter compilers.
- The repeat function for the remote control no longer adapts dynamically
  to the timing of the RCU (this sometimes caused the repeat function to
  kick in too early).
- Channel selection is now blocked when recording or replaying.
- Improved process handling.

2000-05-27: Version 0.05

- Support for more than one DVB card.
- Simultaneous record and replay (with two DVB cards).
- Instant recordings no longer get the name "instant". They now get the name
  of the channel, with a prepended '@' character.
- Timers that are not given an explicit Name now use the channel name with
  a prepended '@' character.
- If an instant recording is currently active, the Main menu now contains
  an option to stop that recording.
- Timers are now only processed when the Menu is not active. So after editing
  a timer the effect will take place only after the menu has been closed.
  In order to avoid missing a timer event by inadvertently leaving the menu
  open, the menu will be closed automatically after about two minutes of
  inactivity.
- If a recording is currently being replayed, the Main menu now contains an
  option to stop replaying.
- Displaying the recording DVB interface status in the decimal points of the
  RCU display.
- Reduced the number of remote control keys. Modified the key assignments for
  the PC keyboard to better resemble the "up-down-left-right-ok" layout on
  menu controlling remote control units.

2000-07-15: Version 0.06

- Added support for LIRC remote control (thanks to Carsten Koch!).
  There are now three different remote control modes: KBD (PC-Keyboard), RCU
  and LIRC. See the INSTALL file for information on how to enable either of
  these modes. The default mode is now KBD, not RCU as before (to make it
  work immediately even if there is no actual remote control).
